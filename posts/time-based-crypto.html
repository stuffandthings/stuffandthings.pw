  <p>If you’re familiar with how 2-Factor authentication works, this might make a little bit more sense. Essentially the server and the client exchange a “key”, this key is an initial seed value number. This is the only piece of information that ever needs to be directly communicated. With this seed, the client and the server automatically generate sequential numbers using some algorithm. At any given moment, the numbers generated by the client and the server are both the same.</p>
<p>The idea behind a time based crypto-protocol is very similar, essentially there is a key exchange at first, and from there all packets being sent to and from the client and server are encrypted using the generated number. So say I send 5 packets in 20 seconds, each of these packets has a timestamp, and is encrypted using the generated number for that 20-second period.</p>
<p>We use symmetric key cryptography, and the server decrypts it using the same generated number, which it already has. This solves one problem, there is no need for a key-exchange after the initial seed value has been exchanged (ideal would be using Diffie-Hellman key exchange), and yet the stream of data is encrypted using different keys. <del>This adds complexity for the attacker without adding computational complexity for the server and client.</del> Silly me. The fact that any stream of data has several rounds of encryption, there will be added complexity for the server and the client since the client will be encrypting several small blocks of data as opposed to just one large block of data.</p>
<p>I haven’t worked out the math of how much more work will be done, but I’ll save that for a later time. An ideal use of this protocol would be text-based communication (instant messaging?) where there isn’t that much data being encrypted/decrypted and so the added work wouldn’t really matter.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough, but of course there are many issues with it. First, if an attacker is able to intercept the initial exchange then the attacker can run the algorithm and using the timestamps decrypt each packet one by one. An advantage here, however, is this: consider that the server and client made the initial exchange 30 hours ago and didn’t start exchanging packets till now, then in order to decrypt the first packets they exchanged the attacker would need to run the algorithm for 30 hours before he is able to decrypt even the first packet. Call this security through annoyance?</p>
<p>I will share a more formal definition of this protocol at a later point.</p>
